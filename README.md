# Play Blackjack in your console! â™  â™¥ â™¦ â™£

console-blackjack is a simple program written for node.js that allows you to play some blackjack in the console.

To get started, type: <br>

```
npx console-blackjack
```

it will ask you to install the `console-blackjack` package, type `yes` or `y` to accept. <br>
Once done, the program will ask for a name and a bet, then enjoy some gambling (not really :P).
